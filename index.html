            <p>Hello, my name is Andrew Weihe. I am a 24 year old student at Vanderbilt's Coding Bootcamp. I was born in Cincinnati, OH but grew up just outside of Detroit. I have been living in the greater Nashville area ever since the early 2000's.</p>

            <p>I originally started school pursuing a degree in Accounting at Western Kentucky University. After coming to the conclusion of not wanting to be stuck at a desk crunching numbers all day long, I decided to move back home and figure things out and start work full-time.</p>

            <p>I have held many different occupations within many different fields, but I still had not found something I was passionate about until now. Thankfully so, I had some good mentors to conversate with and brainstorm about my future with my father and grandpa, both of which whom were CS majors.</p>

            <p>Ultimately, after careful deliberation, our conversations led me into the computer programming field. Web Development, and Web Design are something I truly enjoy creating and learning more about everyday.</p>
